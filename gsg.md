## Introduction

Konveyor is a community of people passionate about helping others modernize and migrate their workloads to the hybrid cloud by building tools, identifying patterns, and providing advice on how to make them Cloud Native, which means break down monoliths, adopt containers, and embrace Kubernetes.

## Governance

konveyor is a federation of sub-projects and as a community, reserves the right of each sub-project to choose their own governance model. For community governance, a representative for each project will be designated to participate in periodic community driven meetings and discussions. This may be quarterly, semi-annual or on an as needed basis.  Additional details will be provided at a future time.

## Licensing

Konveyor projects are strongly encouraged to use the Apache License 2.0, which has become the standard for Cloud Native tools.  Other licenses need specific authorization from Konveyor leadership.

The proposed license for images, documentation and content in Konveyor projects is the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). 

## Project on-boarding

On-boarding is facilitated by a designated community representative. If your project is compelling and is a good fit for the konveyor community, please reach out to

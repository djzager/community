## Inactivity
<!--TODO: project leads to fill in exact details for how you measure inactivity for your project-->
It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and loss of trust in the project. 

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than X months
    * Periods of no communication for longer than X months
* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status

## Involuntary Removal or Demotion
<!-- project leads may want to consider integrating this section under every role description -->

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilites and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated pattern of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled by the community governence committe. 

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process
If and when contributors' committment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project). 

Please reach out to the associated project lead(s) to discuss this process.

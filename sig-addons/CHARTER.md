SIG Addons Charter
==================

SIG Addon's mission is to facilitate community contributions to
Tackle's functionality via addons by advocating for features in the
[hub](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub), functionality in the [addon
library](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-addon), and by demonstrating +
documenting the path for new addons to be accepted.

## Scope

### In Scope

#### Areas of Focus

* Golang bindings for Addons [tackle2-addon](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-addon).
* All [addon repositories](https://github.com/konveyor?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tackle2-addon-&type=&language=)
under the Konveyor organization.
* Developing process for validating/verifying addons for Tackle.

### Cross-cutting

* This SIG works with SIG Core and SIG UI to improve the Konveyor platform for
addon developers.

### Out of Scope

* Business logic behind specific addons. For example, this SIG is responsible
for tackle2-addon-jkube, it does not own the [jkube project](https://github.com/eclipse/jkube).
